Here we use siRNA screening to estimate the genetic dependencies on 714 kinase and kinase-related genes in 117 different tumor cell lines. We provide this dataset as a resource and show that by integrating siRNA data with molecular profiling data, such as exome sequencing, candidate genetic dependencies associated with the mutation of specific cancer driver genescan be identified. By integrating the identified dependencies with interaction datasets, we demonstrate that the kinase dependencies associated with many cancer driver genes form dense connections on functional interaction networks. Finally, we show how this resource may be used to make predictions about the drug sensitivity of genetically or histologically defined subsets of cell lines, including an increased sensitivity of osteosarcoma cell lines to FGFR inhibitors and SMAD4 mutant tumor cells to mitotic inhibitors."	siRNA screen of 714 kinase and kinase-related genes in 117 different tumor cell lines	kinome siRNA	Cell Reports	"2016, 2 Mar"	714	Campbell_CGDs_pancan_witheffectsize_and_zdiff_and_boxplotdata_mutantstate.txt;Campbell_CGDs_bytissue_witheffectsize_and_zdiff_and_boxplotdata_mutantstate.txt	Achilles	25984343	A	Cowley(2014)	Parallel genome-scale loss of function screens in 216 cancer cell lines for the identification of context-specific genetic dependencies.

Cell line dependencies on 11,000 genes were interrogated by 5 shRNAs per gene. The proliferation effect of each shRNA in each cell line was assessed by transducing a population of 11M cells with one shRNA-virus per cell and determining the relative enrichment or depletion of each of the 54,000 shRNAs after 16 population doublings using Next Generation Sequencing. All the cell lines were screened using standardized conditions to best assess differential genetic dependencies across cell lines. When combined with genomic characterization of these cell lines, this dataset facilitates the linkage of genetic dependencies with specific cellular contexts (e.g., gene mutations or cell lineage). To enable such comparisons, we developed and provided a bioinformatics tool to identify linear and nonlinear correlations between these features."

Still, identifying causal variants and emergent vulnerabilities that arise as a consequence of genetic alterations remain major challenges. We performed whole-genome small hairpin RNA (shRNA) \""dropout screens\"" on 77 breast cancer cell lines. Using a hierarchical linear regression algorithm to score our screen results and integrate them with accompanying detailed genetic and proteomic information, we identify vulnerabilities in breast cancer, including candidate \""drivers,\"" and reveal general functional genomic properties of cancer cells. Comparisons of gene essentiality with drug sensitivity data suggest potential resistance mechanisms, effects of existing anti-cancer drugs, and opportunities for combination therapy. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of this large dataset by identifying BRD4 as a potential target in luminal breast cancer and PIK3CA mutations as a resistance determinant for BET-inhibitors."	genome-wide shRNA screen in 77 breast cancer cell lines	genome shRNA	Cell	"2016, 14 Jan"	15697	Marcotte_CGDs_bytissue_witheffectsize_and_zdiff_and_boxplotdata_mutantstate.txt
